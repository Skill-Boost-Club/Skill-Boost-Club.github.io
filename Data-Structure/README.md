## [Structure](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_structs.asp)

> Example: [C](./code/Structure/example.c) | [C++](./code/Structure/example.cpp)

Structure is a user-defined data type in C or C++ that allows to combine data items of different kinds.

## Pointer

> Example: [C](./code/Pointer/example.c) | [C++](./code/Pointer/example.cpp) | [Python](./code/Pointer/example.py)

A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location.
